My **interest** lies at the interface of established research areas -- **the uncharted territory in between the beaten paths**.
We interweave **3 domains** to a unique approach at the forefront of applied computational materials science.

<ul>
    <li>development of theoretical tools to describe the self-consistent and non-perturbative interaction between (quantized) electromagnetic fields and realistic matter from first principles</li>
    <li>advancing green chemistry via polaritonic chemistry, plasmonic catalysis, and chiral polaritonics </li>
    <li>predicting novel quantum-impurity systems, exploring quantum scrambling, and developing near-term quantum algorithmic</li>
</ul>
